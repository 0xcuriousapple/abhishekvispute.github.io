### [Autonomous Sidechains]
Blockchain is one of the most promising and rapidly growing technologies and is also considered as the technology of the future. But till date it is mostly used for transactions which involve digital assets. To expand the scope of blockchain beyond cryptocurrency it is really important to rethink the structure of existing blockchain architecture. One of the major factors which holds blockchain back from being a popular digital payment option is the transaction speed. Scalability limits the scope of blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrencies.\newline
This paper presents the architecture solution for scalable blockchain using the concept of Autonomous Sidechains based on plasma framework. Instead of forcing implementation of all transactions to the mainchain we create a new sidechain for every unique decentralized application implemented on the main network which is bound to the mainchain. This concept increases the overall throughput of the blockchain architecture by reducing the block generation time and hence increases the scalability of the entire network.
