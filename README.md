### Autonomous Sidechains
This project presents the architecture solution for scalable blockchain using the concept of Autonomous Sidechains based on plasma framework. Instead of forcing implementation of all transactions to the mainchain we create a new sidechain for every unique decentralized application implemented on the main network which is bound to the mainchain. This concept increases the overall throughput of the blockchain architecture by reducing the block generation time and hence increases the scalability of the entire network.
